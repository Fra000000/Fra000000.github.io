      <p>Our agency client had previously worked with a number of media partners depending on the project, however after many successful projects, we became their lead media partner.</p>
      
      <h3>How did you select Flower?</h3>
      <p>Flower became our preferred partner through our initial RFP process. We had worked with a number of media partners depending on the project, however after many successful projects, they became our lead.</p>

      <h4>Describe the scope of their work in detail.</h4>
        <p>We were able to work in true partnership with Flower and they became an extension of our digital team. For this project we engaged their team with the initial client brief and walked through the brief on a call with the Flower team.</p>
        <p>We answered any questions, shared our initial thinking and brainstormed some media options. From there the Flower team had internal meetings and put together a proposal based on the brief.</p>
        <p>This proposal focused on recommended media channels (including strategic rationale), breakdown of spend by channel and estimated outcomes. Once the plan was approved by client, Flower executed all media, provided weekly check-ins on results and provided a final report on results.</p>
        <p>The Flower team also checked in throughout the campaign to make adjustments to the media to improve performance.</p>
